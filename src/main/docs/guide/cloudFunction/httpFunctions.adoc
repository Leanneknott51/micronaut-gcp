It is common to want to take just a slice of a regular Micronaut HTTP server application and deploy it as a function.

To facilitate this model, Micronaut GCP includes an additional module that allows you to use regular Micronaut annotations like `@Controller` and `@Get` to define your functions that can be deployed to cloud function.

With this model you need to add the `micronaut-gcp-function-http-server` dependency to your application:

dependency:io.micronaut.gcp:micronaut-gcp-function-http-server[version="{version}"]

You should then make the regular Micronaut server a `developmentOnly` dependency since it is not necessary to include it in the JAR file that will be deployed to Cloud Function:

dependency:io.micronaut:micronaut-http-server-netty[scope="developmentOnly"]

When deploying the function to Cloud Function you should use the api:.gcp.function.http.HttpFunction[] class as the handler reference.

First build the function with:

```bash
$ ./gradlew clean shadowJar
```

Then `cd` into the `build/libs` directory (deployment has to be done from the location where the JAR file resides):

```bash
$ cd build/libs
```

To deploy the function make sure you have `gcloud` CLI then run:

```bash
$ gcloud alpha functions deploy myfunction --entry-point io.micronaut.gcp.function.http.HttpFunction --runtime java11 --trigger-http
```

In the example above `myfunction` refers to the name of your function and can be changed to whatever name you prefer to name your function.

To obtain the trigger URL you can use the following command:

```bash
$ YOUR_HTTP_TRIGGER_URL=$(gcloud alpha functions describe myfunction --format='value(httpsTrigger.url)')
```

You can then use this variable to test the function invocation:

```bash
$ curl -i $YOUR_HTTP_TRIGGER_URL/hello/John
```
